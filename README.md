C# (Csharp) BlackJack Game

This is a quick console blackjack game I made in C#. The console is the dealer and obviously you're the user. I was going to add the card Suite names on each draw as well, but I didnt have time (busy with coding at work). Anyways, I'll come back and add the suite names on each card draw. Otherwise, the main logic for blackjack is there and enjoy it! The code is in the other file named c# code.
